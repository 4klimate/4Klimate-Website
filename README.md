# Klimate
Klimate is a website that gives you helpful suggestions on how to help the environment daily. It  was created with the idea that you do not have to spend lots of money to help the environment. Currently, it is just in the prototype stage so the examples on the website are just static and will gradually gain functionality. Go check it out at https://klimate.robertrover811.repl.co/index.html.
